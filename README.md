# projects
1- Persona : 
  Persona is a research project in QCRI, Qatar Computing Research Institute, An approach for automating generating personas in real time using actual social media data from a global media corporation that produces online digital content. But we tuned and modified this approach to work on our own data then injected it as a docker service in a big multi-services project, this component was developed in Java and many technologies were used like Spark, Jersey, Maven, R, Rserve.


2- Skin Cander Detection : 
  My Graduation Project, Computer Aided Melanoma Detection, we propose a non-invasive diagnosis system of melanoma using computer vision and machine learning techniques.
The diagnosis system consists of  stages which are: Segmentation, Feature Extraction, and Classification.
The input for the segmentation stage is the lesion image, the output of the segmentation is a lesion mask specifying the image pixels that contain the lesion. Feature extraction techniques use that mask (segmentation output) and extract the necessary features that are going to be used in the classification stage. Binary classification is used with each set of features extracted by each feature extraction technique, and results of correctly classified percentage, sensitivity and specificity are emitted.

3- Paint and brush:
  A paint application, implemented in Java, With the following details:
    - We designed an object oriented model that covers the following geometric shapes: Line, Circle, Ellipse, Triangle, Rectangle and Square.
    - We applied the concepts of inheritance and polymorphism to your design.
    - We designed and implemented a GUI that allows the following functionalities for the user on all the shapes like draw, edit the color, undo, redo, resizing, moving , etc.
    - Dynamic class loading was implemented to allow user, at run time, to extend the application features by adding a new compiled shape model.
    - Save and load user's drawings in a file and modifying it later.
